# Radiology-agentic-system
A multimodal  deep learning framework for glioma 3D segmentation, radiology report generation ,radiogenomic analysis  and treatment plan.
# Study objective  

The objective of this study was to design and evaluate a biologically inspired 3D deep learning architecture that integrates spatial attention and multi-branch convolutional pathways to enhance glioma segmentation, tumor type and grade classification, molecular marker prediction, and survival estimation. In the final step, the outputs of the model are used to generate automated radiology reports, which are further processed by a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to suggest individualized treatment plans.
# Rationale 
Management of glioma patients faces several clinical challenges:

•	Molecular testing and tumor classification require surgical biopsy, which carries procedural risks and potential delays.

•	Biopsies from multiple tumor sites are often needed due to inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity.

•	Manual delineation and interpretation of imaging are time-consuming, costly, and prone to inter-radiologist variability.

To address these challenges, our approach emphasizes boundary-sensitive learning and multimodal feature fusion while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for large-scale clinical use. We hypothesize that incorporating biologically inspired mechanisms and attention-driven modules will enable the model to generate clinically relevant, interpretable predictions, bridging the gap between radiological imaging and precision oncology.
